OpenCart admin backend for modifying settings.

INSTALLATION
------------
1) Upload the contents of the 'Upload' directory to the root of your OpenCart site.
2) Login to your OpenCart admin, go to the Extensions -> Modules page, and click 'Install' next to 'Piwik'.
3) After install, click 'Edit' next to 'Piwik', and on the settings page enter the details about your site and the Piwik installation;

a) "Piwik installation URL" - This is the full url to your Piwik installation (including 'http://'). e.g. "http://www.example.com/piwik/". This MUST include the trailing '/' on the end!
b) "Piwik installation URL (https)" - Same as above, but for secure https. e.g. "https://www.example.com/piwik/". This MUST include the trailing '/' on the end!
c) "Full path to the PiwikTracker.php file" - As the name says, this is your server filepath to your PiwikTracker.php file in your Piwik folder - commonly this will be "/home/~user/public_html/piwik/PiwikTracker.php", where '~user' is replaced by your website hosting username. However this can vary depending on the server configuration.
d) "Piwik auth token" - This is your secret Piwik authorisation token. Get this from the 'API' tab on your Piwik admin panel.
e) "Piwik Site ID" - This is the ID used in your Piwik install for the site you want to track, usually this is '1' but can vary if you have multiple sites or a custom setup. Consult the 'Website Management' page on your Piwik admin panel for this setting (under Settings -> Websites).
f) "Ecommerce tracking" - Set this to 'Enabled' to allow tracking of Ecommerce actions such as product views, cart operations and orders. Set this to 'Disabled' if you only wish to track regular page views.
g) "Piwik SKU" - Select what product field you would like to use when reporting the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) in an Ecommerce operation. This can use either OpenCarts 'Model' product field, or the 'SKU' product field.
h) "Piwik Tracking" - Global 'Enabled' / 'Disabled' setting for the Piwik OpenCart mod (functionality not yet implemented!).



IMPORTANT
---------
1. Requires VQmod installed (Highly recommended - https://code.google.com/p/vqmod/ ).

2. Requires Piwik installed.

3. The default install assumes that Piwik is installed to the '/piwik/' folder at the root of your OpenCart site.
If you have used a custom install path then please place the 'PiwikTracker.php' file from '/upload/piwik/PiwikTracker.php' to your custom Piwik folder.

4. The default install assumes that your OpenCart Admin directory is in the '/admin/' folder at the root of your OpenCart site.
If you have used a custom Admin path then please place all files from '/upload/admin/' to your custom OpenCart Admin folder.

5. Only tested on OpenCart 1.5.3.1 & 1.5.4.1, VQmod 2.1.6 & 2.1.7, and Piwik 1.8.4, 1.9.1 & 1.11.1.
(may well work on others - please tell me what you find out!)



LIMITATIONS
-----------
This is an early release and is functional, but still needs further finishing touches and testing. Please report any bugs found!
1) There is no functionality (yet) to track the category during page views / cart updates / orders.
2) The "Piwik Tracking" global enable/disable setting on the mod settings page is not yet functional.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
There is a bug with PiwikTracker.php and OpenCart due to 'HTTP_REFERRER' being used without checking if it is defined or not. This code has an '@' symbol to suppress the error but for some reason this doesn't always work.
The symptom is text at the top of your site which is similar to "Notice: Undefined index: HTTP_REFERER in ????/PiwikTracker.php on line 84".
To turn off the display of the error on your site, go to your opencart admin. Go to System > Settings , click 'edit' by your site, then click the 'Server' tab. At the bottom change "Display Errors:" from 'yes' to 'no'. That will stop it displaying.



SUPPORT
-------
I'm happy to help if you have any problems (though can't promise large amounts of time).
I'm also keen to get your feedback (dont be afraid to be critical if I've done something wrong!).
It would be great to hear of your experiences and what could be improved.
